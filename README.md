# Movie Recommendation System

This is a basic movie recommendation system built using Python and Flask. It provides personalized movie suggestions based on a simple in-house algorithm.

## Features

*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  The system analyzes user preferences to provide tailored movie suggestions.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A minimalistic and intuitive interface enhances user engagement.
*   **Seamless Integration:** The backend and frontend are seamlessly integrated for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The core logic and recommendation algorithm are implemented in Python.
*   **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to build the application's backend and serve the frontend.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**  Used for creating the user interface and frontend interactions.

## How it Works
It simply ask user for genre and then with the help of RESTful API the selection genres are send to backend. At backend, custom SQL query is created and hit then this request is sent to a SQL Database. After, we found film with matching genre we send back response to frontend. This is the basic algorithm that this project works on. 


## Getting Started

(Provide instructions on how to run the application locally, if applicable. This could include steps like cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running the Flask server.)

## Future Improvements

*   **Enhanced Algorithm:** Implement a more sophisticated recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches).
*   **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles and save their preferences for more personalized recommendations.
*   **Movie Database:** Integrate with a larger movie database (e.g., TMDB) to provide a wider range of recommendations.
*   **Improved UI:** Enhance the user interface with features like search, filtering, and user reviews.

## Contribution
*  **Contribution is no longer needed, this project is over and no further changes will be made to this repository**
