# Movie Recommendation System

This is a basic movie recommendation system built using Python and Flask. It provides personalized movie suggestions based on a simple in-house algorithm.

## Features

*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  The system analyzes user preferences to provide tailored movie suggestions.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A minimalistic and intuitive interface enhances user engagement.
*   **Seamless Integration:** The backend and frontend are seamlessly integrated for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The core logic and recommendation algorithm are implemented in Python.
*   **Flask:** A lightweight web framework used to build the application's backend and serve the frontend.
*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**  Used for creating the user interface and frontend interactions.

## How it Works

(Describe the basic recommendation algorithm here. Since your draft resume mentions it's a "basic in-house algorithm," you can briefly explain the logic without going into complex details. For example, you could mention if it's based on genre preferences, collaborative filtering, or content-based filtering.)

## Getting Started

(Provide instructions on how to run the application locally, if applicable. This could include steps like cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running the Flask server.)

## Future Improvements

*   **Enhanced Algorithm:** Implement a more sophisticated recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches).
*   **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles and save their preferences for more personalized recommendations.
*   **Movie Database:** Integrate with a larger movie database (e.g., TMDB) to provide a wider range of recommendations.
*   **Improved UI:** Enhance the user interface with features like search, filtering, and user reviews.

## Contribution
*  **Contribution is no longer needed, this project is over and no further changes will be made to this repository**
